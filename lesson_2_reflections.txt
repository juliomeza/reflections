What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I hidden folder called .git is created. I need to do it to store all changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area if where I stored the files that I want to commit. Repository is where the commit files goes after each commit.
